2048:
1. Spawn boxes
	spawn at random free grid
		iterate over array and find # of free spots[D]
		pick random # in that range[D]
		iterate over array and put box in that #[D]
	start at 2 or 4 (random - are 2s more common?)[D]
	start from point at center and grow (quickly!) (LATER)
2. box types
	color and text for each number [D]
3. movement
	on arrow key, move boxes all the way in that direction 
		until/unless they're blocked by an edge or a different block
4. Adding
	if there is a collision between two block types:
		1. check if they are the same. if not, block stops
		2. if same, add numbers
		3. block goes into (on top of? behind?) other block
		4 -> turns into 1 new block (is this totally new or does one of them change?)
	
shift logic:
	for each square (loop through columns)
	(recursive)
		1. if the next space is end, STOP
		2. if the next space is free, move once 
		3. if the next space has a number
			a. if numbers are different, STOP
			b. if numbers are the same		
				i. move
				ii. disappear
				iii.the stopped number gets multiplied by 2
